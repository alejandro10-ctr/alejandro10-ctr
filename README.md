### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alejandro from Argentina, I started to develop about an year ago. I really enjoy learning new languages and frameworks like React, Redux, Node, Express, etc. 
I've been doing Henry's bootcamp where we made a couple of single page apps, an  ecommerce and learning a lot and really wish to keep learning and developing myself.
